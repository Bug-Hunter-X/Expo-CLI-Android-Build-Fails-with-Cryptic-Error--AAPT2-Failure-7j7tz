# Expo CLI Android Build Failure: AAPT2 Error

This repository demonstrates a common yet frustrating issue with the Expo CLI when building Android APKs. The build process unexpectedly fails with a generic error message, such as `Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugResources'.  > AAPT2 aapt2-3.4.0-7582617-windows`, making it incredibly difficult to diagnose the problem.  This repository provides example code and solutions to help you understand and resolve this issue.

## Problem Description:

* Conflicting or incompatible dependencies.
* Issues with the Android SDK or build tools.
* Problems with the project's asset files.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `expo prebuild`.
3. Run `expo build:android`. 
4. Observe the error message.

This includes strategies such as cleaning the build cache, checking for conflicting dependencies, ensuring that the Android SDK and build tools are up-to-date and correctly configured, and troubleshooting specific issues with the project assets or the app's Gradle files.
