This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK. The build process fails with a cryptic error message, such as `Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugResources'.  > AAPT2 aapt2-3.4.0-7582617-windows`, without providing clear information about the underlying cause. This can happen even if the code itself is free of errors.  The issue is particularly challenging to troubleshoot because the error message is not directly related to the code but to an underlying problem in the build process, which may be due to dependencies, configuration files, or environmental factors. The inconsistent error messaging and lack of detailed logging during the build process makes it extremely difficult to identify and fix the root cause.
