The solution to this issue is multifaceted and requires a systematic approach to troubleshoot the Android build process. Here's a breakdown of common strategies:

**1. Clean and Rebuild:**
Start by cleaning the project's build cache. In the project's root directory, run:

```bash
./gradlew clean
```

Then try building again using `expo build:android`. This often resolves temporary issues.

**2. Check Dependencies:**
Examine your `package.json` file and make sure that all your dependencies are compatible with Expo and the Android platform.  Look for conflicting dependencies or outdated packages.  Try updating packages or resolving any dependency conflicts.

**3. Update Android SDK and Build Tools:**
Ensure your Android SDK and build tools are up to date. In Android Studio (or using the Android SDK command-line tools), update the components to their latest versions.

**4. Investigate Asset Files:**
Review your project's assets (images, fonts, etc.).  Any issues with these files (incorrectly formatted images, missing files, etc.) can cause AAPT2 to fail. Ensure all assets are properly formatted and placed in the correct directories.

**5. Review Gradle Files:**
Carefully check your `android/app/build.gradle` and `android/build.gradle` files. Errors in these files can significantly impact the build process. Verify all configurations, dependencies, and plugins are correct and compatible.

**6. Detailed Logging:**
Increase the verbosity of the build logs to get more detailed error messages.  Consult Expo documentation for ways to enable more comprehensive logging during the build process. This can provide valuable clues about the exact nature of the issue.

**7. Expo Diagnostics:**
Use Expo's built-in diagnostics tools (if available) to gather information about your environment and project setup. This can help pinpoint potential conflicts.

By systematically implementing these troubleshooting steps, you should be able to identify the root cause of the build error and successfully build your Android APK.
